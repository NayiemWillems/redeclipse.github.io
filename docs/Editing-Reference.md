## [Entities](Editing-Entities)
 
 Entities are shown within editmode as purple blips. When aiming the editing crosshair towards one, you will see the billboard attributes which can modified.
 An entity can be moved around by selecting any side of the green box which appears, and dragging it towards the desired direction.
